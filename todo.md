# To Do

[] Add support for forms that utilize htmlFor, so it selects the root
[] Add support for utilizing nth-type selectors
[] Fail a selector when it ends up targetting a parent because its direct model is effectively null
[] Add a filter function for certain attributes (e.g. if the id follows the React useID pattern :r0: <-- this is a strong indicator of an unstable ID>)
[] Suggest the interactive element you might be after -- e.g. if you click an icon in a button
